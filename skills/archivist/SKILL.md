# archivist

Take a set of articles and write up what they demand of the layers above.
**Do not write articles.**

Documents live under `docs/archivist/` in six directories, one per node.
Directory names are plural. Names the project fills in are LARGE_SNAKE_CASE;
headings are PascalCase.

## Input

Articles placed in `docs/archivist/L4_articles/`. Any range - one file,
all of them, any subset. A topic with no document there is out of scope;
writing an article is not this skill's work.

## When there is nothing to read

`L4_articles/` empty is not a failure of this skill and not an article to write
here. Write nothing, say that `archivist-adopt` is what fills it, and stop.

**Point at it; do not call it.** Say nothing about it when the directory is not
empty.

## Order

Write upward. Never skip a layer.

1. `archivist-term` — words the article fixed the meaning of
2. `archivist-structure` — forms the article imposes
3. `archivist-spec` — promises derivable from the article
3. `archivist-design` — what solves them
4. `archivist-feature` — the unit a user can name, and where the two halves of
   step 3 are set against each other

**Spec and design share a step.** Neither cites the other, so neither waits for the
other; write them in either order or at the same time. Only the feature above needs
both to be there.

Skip a step when it has nothing to write. **Not skipping layers and writing one
document per layer are different things.**

## How far it travels

When an existing article changed, find the documents citing it. There is no index.

```
grep -rl 'ARTICLE_FILE_NAME' docs/archivist/
```

Rewrite what you find, then find what cites those. Stop when nothing above is reached.

A new article returns nothing from this search. Judge from its content where it
lands. The more an article is written in the vocabulary of L1, the more carefully
check L3 first - an article often fixes the meaning of the very words it uses.

## Stopping

On reaching something the article does not yield, stop without writing it and say
what is missing. Filling that gap is an article, and articles are written elsewhere.

## Language

Write documents in the language the project's existing documents use. Where none
exist, follow the language the articles are written in. Headings and field names
stay in English - they are form, not prose.

## When done

Run `archivist-check`.
